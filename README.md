# MateCat Filters: convert any file to XLIFF and back

With MateCat Filters you can easily extract all the translatable contents of any file in a convenient XML compliant with the XLIFF standard.

Put the translated contents in the XML and use again MateCat Filters to have back the original file perfectly translated.

Fast, reliable and scalable, running everyday inside MateCat, the popular open-source CAT tool.

32 formats supported directly + 26 supported using the MateCat Win Converter
See the [full list](//github.com/matecat/matecat_filters/wiki/Supported-file-formats) in the Wiki.

#### Advanced segmentation

Using the Unicode ICU Library, MateCat Filters implement the rules defined by the Unicode consortium to properly split sentences in every language. On top of this we also added a set of rules specifically designed for the CATs world.
